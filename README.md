Elumna offers the portfolio of the alumni user has searched for. 
The portfolio includes qualifications, past experiences, current 
job, internships they did, how they cracked the interviews (QnAs). 
The individualsâ€™ growth chart will be provided on the basis of 
income, appraisals, possibilities the individual explores in the 
respective field. There will be a poke option for ensuring privacy. 
An alert option will be added for the alumni if any user wants to 
know their further information. 
 And this platform is available in form of an application ( available

take care of the people who haven't been connected through the 
platform and further register them. The database has the ability 
of providing access of the data to the admin.
